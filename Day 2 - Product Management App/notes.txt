    Everything in Java is an object.
A product is an object basically.

Product(Entity) has properties. 
  - name
  - type
  - place
  - warranty

If you want an object, you create a class first.

In Object Oriented Programming we have a concept called Encapsulation, all your properties should be private.
The way to access them should be using getters and setters.

To print an object we implement toString method.

Delegation - you dont do everything by yourself. Main will not do everything.

Enhanced for loop

Assignment - 1. Search based on place
             2. Products out of warranty
             3. Convert getProductsWithText to stream api

Once you consume a stream, you cannot reuse it. You can only use it once.
